# Branch structure

There are only three branches currently in steady usage in the helloX repository: `master`, `dev`, and `documentation`. The `master` branch is used for the current, live state of the website, the `dev` branch is used for all changes related to the functionality of the project, and `documentation` is used for all changes related to documentation. Pull requests should be made to pull both branches into `master`, whereupon the project is built and tested on the Travis continuous integration server. Alternately, `documentation` can be pulled into `dev`, which can then be pulled into `master`. See `documentation/continuous-integration.md` for more details. If multiple developers are working on the project simultaneously, new branches should be created.
