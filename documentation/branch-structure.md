# Branch structure

There are only three branches currently in steady usage in the helloX repository: `master`, `dev`, and `documentation`. The `dev` branch is used for all changes related to the functionality of the project, `documentation` is used for all changes related to documentation. Pull requests should be made to pull both branches into `master`, whereupon the project is built and tested on the Travis continuous integration server. See `documentation/continuous-integration.md` for more details.  If multiple developers are working on the project simultaneously, new branches should be created.
