# Continuous Integration testing

The Hello X client uses Travis CI for continuous integration of testing. (Note, however, that it does *not* use continuous delivery. This would be easy to add but has little value at present.) Changes should be committed on a non-master branch, then a pull request should be made to pull them into the `master` branch. You may need to wait 5-10 minutes and/or refresh before the result of the Travis test run appears on the pull request page. If the tests pass, pull the changes into `master`; if not, add new commits fixing the errors, and repeat the aforementioned steps. Do **not**, except in the most dire circumstances, accept a pull request into `master` if tests are failing.
